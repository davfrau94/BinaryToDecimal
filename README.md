Decimal to Binary
This is a  Decimal to Binary Converter web application built as part of a [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) exercise, under the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures curriculum.

The app was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and allows users to input decimal numbers and to convert them into binary numbers.

I learned the fundamental concepts of recursion, explore the call stack, and build out a visual representation of the recursion process through an animation.
